# Note Taker

This is a Node.js and Express.js application that allows the user to enter in a note title and note text. That note is then saved in the left-hand column of the page. Users can access saved notes by clicking on them. This loads them in the main section of the page. Note data persists even after the page is refreshed or the server is killed and restarted.
